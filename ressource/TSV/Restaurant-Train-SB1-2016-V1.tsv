1004293:0	1004293:0	56	51	negative	Judging from previous posts this used to be a good place, but not any longer.
1004293:1	1004293:1	56	51	negative	We, there were four of us, arrived at noon - the place was empty - and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude.
1004293:2	1004293:2	56	51	negative	They never brought us complimentary noodles, ignored repeated requests for sugar, and threw our dishes on the table.
1004293:3	1004293:3	56	51	negative	The food was lousy - too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny.
1004293:4	1004293:4	56	51	negative	After all that, they complained to me about the small tip.
1004293:5	1004293:5	56	51	negative	Avoid this place!
1014458:0	1014458:0	56	51	negative	I have eaten at Saul, many times, the food is always consistently, outrageously good.
1014458:1	1014458:1	56	51	negative	Saul is the best restaurant on Smith Street and in Brooklyn.
1014458:2	1014458:2	56	51	negative	The duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world.
1014458:3	1014458:3	56	51	negative	The wine list is interesting and has many good values.
1014458:4	1014458:4	56	51	negative	For the price, you cannot eat this well in Manhattan.
1016296:0	1016296:0	56	51	negative	I was very disappointed with this restaurant.
1016296:1	1016296:1	56	51	negative	Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.
1016296:2	1016296:2	56	51	negative	I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.
1016296:3	1016296:3	56	51	negative	Food was okay, nothing great.
1016296:4	1016296:4	56	51	negative	Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family. 
1016296:5	1016296:5	56	51	negative	I/we will never go back to this place again.
1028246:0	1028246:0	56	51	negative	Went on a 3 day oyster binge, with Fish bringing up the closing, and I am so glad this was the place it O trip ended, because it was so great!
1028246:1	1028246:1	56	51	negative	Service was devine, oysters where a sensual as they come, and the price can't be beat!!!
1028246:2	1028246:2	56	51	negative	You can't go wrong here.
1032695:0	1032695:0	56	51	negative	Every time in New York I make it a point to visit Restaurant Saul on Smith Street.
1032695:1	1032695:1	56	51	negative	Everything is always cooked to perfection, the service is excellent, the decor cool and understated.
1032695:2	1032695:2	56	51	negative	I had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible.
1032695:3	1032695:3	56	51	negative	Can't wait wait for my next visit.
1041457:0	1041457:0	56	51	negative	I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.' 
1041457:1	1041457:1	56	51	negative	And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back. 
1041457:2	1041457:2	56	51	negative	The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.
1041457:3	1041457:3	56	51	negative	The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.
1041457:4	1041457:4	56	51	negative	I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).
1041457:5	1041457:5	56	51	negative	Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.
1041457:6	1041457:6	56	51	negative	The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.
1053543:0	1053543:0	56	51	negative	We ate outside at Haru's Sake bar because Haru's restaurant next door was overflowing.
1053543:1	1053543:1	56	51	negative	What's the difference between the two?
1053543:2	1053543:2	56	51	negative	Their sake list was extensive, but we were looking for Purple Haze, which wasn't listed but made for us upon request!
1053543:3	1053543:3	56	51	negative	The spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome, great appetizer to share!
1053543:4	1053543:4	56	51	negative	We went around 9:30 on a Friday and it had died down a bit by then so the service was great!
1055910:0	1055910:0	56	51	negative	we love th pink pony.
1055910:1	1055910:1	56	51	negative	THe perfect spot.
1055910:2	1055910:2	56	51	negative	Food-awesome.
1055910:3	1055910:3	56	51	negative	Service- friendly and attentive.
1055910:4	1055910:4	56	51	negative	Ambiance- relaxed and stylish.
1055910:5	1055910:5	56	51	negative	Don't judge this place prima facie, you have to try it to believe it, a home away from home for the literate heart.
1058221:0	1058221:0	56	51	negative	i have eaten here a handful of times, for no reason besides sheer convenience.
1058221:1	1058221:1	56	51	negative	(i hang out, and live, in the neighborhood..) 
1058221:2	1058221:2	56	51	negative	the food is decent.
1058221:3	1058221:3	56	51	negative	however, it's the service that leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
1058221:4	1058221:4	56	51	negative	i happen to have a policy that goes along with a little bit of self-respect, which includes not letting a waiter intimidate me, i.e. make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water, or the check.
1058221:5	1058221:5	56	51	negative	i know, you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored, but my agenda is i'm here to eat and enjoy the company of friends, seeking a pleasant experience.
1058221:6	1058221:6	56	51	negative	well, i didn't find it there, and trust, i have told everyone i can think of about my experience. 
1058221:7	1058221:7	56	51	negative	the last time i walked by it looked pretty empty. hmmm.
1062641:0	1062641:0	56	51	negative	This place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area.
1062641:1	1062641:1	56	51	negative	I had a great experience.
1062641:2	1062641:2	56	51	negative	Food is great.
1062641:3	1062641:3	56	51	negative	Service is top notch.
1062641:4	1062641:4	56	51	negative	I have been going back again and again.
1064477:0	1064477:0	56	51	negative	I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.
1064477:1	1064477:1	56	51	negative	It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.
1064477:2	1064477:2	56	51	negative	The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.
1064477:3	1064477:3	56	51	negative	The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.
1064477:4	1064477:4	56	51	negative	We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.
1074868:0	1074868:0	56	51	negative	I went to this restaurant with a woman that I met recently.
1074868:1	1074868:1	56	51	negative	She lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy.
1074868:2	1074868:2	56	51	negative	Surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth.
1074868:3	1074868:3	56	51	negative	In the evening, this place attracted a well dressed, with it, NY crowd.
1074868:4	1074868:4	56	51	negative	The food was well prepared and the service impecable.
1074868:5	1074868:5	56	51	negative	I'm going back.
1084394:0	1084394:0	56	51	negative	Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.
1084394:1	1084394:1	56	51	negative	Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.
1084394:2	1084394:2	56	51	negative	The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.
1084394:3	1084394:3	56	51	negative	The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).
1084394:4	1084394:4	56	51	negative	I will be going back and heartily recommend it!
1086415:0	1086415:0	56	51	negative	I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.
1086415:1	1086415:1	56	51	negative	It is terrific, as is the value.
1086415:2	1086415:2	56	51	negative	$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.
1086415:3	1086415:3	56	51	negative	I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.
1086415:4	1086415:4	56	51	negative	Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.
1086415:5	1086415:5	56	51	negative	Go hungry and enjoy.
1086478:0	1086478:0	56	51	negative	The food here is rather good, but only if you like to wait for it.
1086478:1	1086478:1	56	51	negative	I like the somosas, chai, and the chole, but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing.
1086478:2	1086478:2	56	51	negative	The service varys from day to day- sometimes they're very nice, and sometimes not.
1086478:3	1086478:3	56	51	negative	The kitchen however, is almost always slow.
1086478:4	1086478:4	56	51	negative	Also, specify if you like your food spicy- its rather bland if you don't.
1086478:5	1086478:5	56	51	negative	The ambience is pretty and nice for conversation, so a casual lunch here would probably be best.
1090587:0	1090587:0	56	51	negative	Just went here for my girlfriends 23rd bday.
1090587:1	1090587:1	56	51	negative	If you've ever been along the river in Weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer.
1090587:2	1090587:2	56	51	negative	Add to that great service and great food at a reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of a great evening.
1090587:3	1090587:3	56	51	negative	The lava cake dessert was incredible and I recommend it.
1102681:0	1102681:0	56	51	negative	Once you step into Cosette, you're miraculously in a small, off-the-beaten path Parisian bistro.
1102681:1	1102681:1	56	51	negative	This tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets, with that certain Parisian flair.
1102681:2	1102681:2	56	51	negative	The food was average to above-average; the French Onion soup filling yet not overly impressive, and the desserts not brilliant in any way.
1102681:3	1102681:3	56	51	negative	However, go for the ambience, and consider the food just a companion for a trip across the world!
1118167:0	1118167:0	56	51	negative	I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.
1118167:1	1118167:1	56	51	negative	IT WAS HORRIBLE.
1118167:2	1118167:2	56	51	negative	The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!
1118167:3	1118167:3	56	51	negative	It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.
1118167:4	1118167:4	56	51	negative	I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.
1119578:0	1119578:0	56	51	negative	This has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in Brooklyn.
1119578:1	1119578:1	56	51	negative	The pizza is overpriced and soggy.
1119578:2	1119578:2	56	51	negative	Yes, they use fancy ingredients, but even fancy ingredients don't make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right.
1119578:3	1119578:3	56	51	negative	A big disappointment, all around.
1123262:0	1123262:0	56	51	negative	I think I've had some the best meals of my life at minnow.
1123262:1	1123262:1	56	51	negative	The seafood is amazing, there's a good wine list, and the ever-changing menu always offers some great surprises.
1123262:2	1123262:2	56	51	negative	The combination of super-fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious.
1123262:3	1123262:3	56	51	negative	Worth the trip from Manhattan.
1125006:0	1125006:0	56	51	negative	Was there Friday night.
1125006:1	1125006:1	56	51	negative	Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.
1125006:2	1125006:2	56	51	negative	And I've been to many NYC delis.
1125006:3	1125006:3	56	51	negative	My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.
1125006:4	1125006:4	56	51	negative	Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.
1125284:0	1125284:0	56	51	negative	As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.
1125284:1	1125284:1	56	51	negative	This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.
1125284:2	1125284:2	56	51	negative	The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.
1125284:3	1125284:3	56	51	negative	This place is worth an one-hour drive.
1125284:4	1125284:4	56	51	negative	I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.
1126814:0	1126814:0	56	51	negative	Leon is an East Village gem: casual but hip, with well prepared basic French bistro fare, good specials, a warm and lively atmosphere.
1126814:1	1126814:1	56	51	negative	My wife and I always enjoy the young, not always well trained but nevertheless friendly, staff, all of whom have a story.
1126814:2	1126814:2	56	51	negative	Sit outside in the warm weather; inside for cozy winter.
1126814:3	1126814:3	56	51	negative	Decent wine at reasonable prices.
1126814:4	1126814:4	56	51	negative	Have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience.
1126814:5	1126814:5	56	51	negative	Our teenage kids love it, too.
1126886:0	1126886:0	56	51	negative	Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.
1126886:1	1126886:1	56	51	negative	This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.
1126886:2	1126886:2	56	51	negative	The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.
1126886:3	1126886:3	56	51	negative	You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.
1126886:4	1126886:4	56	51	negative	I'm partial to the Gnocchi.
1131595:0	1131595:0	56	51	negative	This place is incredibly tiny.
1131595:1	1131595:1	56	51	negative	They refuse to seat parties of 3 or more on weekends.
1131595:2	1131595:2	56	51	negative	The hostess is rude to the point of being offensive.
1131595:3	1131595:3	56	51	negative	The food was bland oily.
1131595:4	1131595:4	56	51	negative	I just don't understand all the hype...
1138996:0	1138996:0	56	51	negative	We went to Ino for Valentines.
1138996:1	1138996:1	56	51	negative	We have been to this place many times, and always have great food, wine, and service.
1138996:2	1138996:2	56	51	negative	We were worried we would have trouble getting in, but somehow managed to have a short wait.
1138996:3	1138996:3	56	51	negative	As always we had a great glass of wine while we waited.
1138996:4	1138996:4	56	51	negative	When we sat, we got great and fast service.
1138996:5	1138996:5	56	51	negative	The people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in New York sometimes.
1138996:6	1138996:6	56	51	negative	Make sure you try this place as often as you can.
1145510:0	1145510:0	56	51	negative	This is a fun restaurant to go to.
1145510:1	1145510:1	56	51	negative	The pizza is yummy and I like the atmoshpere.
1145510:2	1145510:2	56	51	negative	But the pizza is way to expensive.
1145510:3	1145510:3	56	51	negative	A large is $20, and toppings are about $3 each.
1147082:0	1147082:0	56	51	negative	I went there for lunch and it was not as good as I expected from the reviews I read.
1147082:1	1147082:1	56	51	negative	Sauce was watery and the food didn't have much flavor.
1147082:2	1147082:2	56	51	negative	If you like the food and the value you get from some of Chinatown restaurants, this is not the place for you.
1147082:3	1147082:3	56	51	negative	I don't think I would go again.
1147211:0	1147211:0	56	51	negative	This place is great.

1154550:2	1154550:2	56	51	negative	Get the tuna of gari.
1154550:3	1154550:3	56	51	negative	The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.

1162037:1	1162037:1	56	51	negative	With the great variety on the menu , I eat here often and never get bored .
1162037:2	1162037:2	56	51	negative	The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .
1162037:3	1162037:3	56	51	negative	It's all about the food !!
1167434:0	1167434:0	56	51	negative	I went there with my friend last saturday.
1167434:1	1167434:1	56	51	negative	first it took us a long time to find the place.
1167434:2	1167434:2	56	51	negative	we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant, then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers.
1167434:3	1167434:3	56	51	negative	but when we looked at the menu, there weren't a lot of choices, most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section.
1167434:4	1167434:4	56	51	negative	then we ordered a dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi.
1167434:5	1167434:5	56	51	negative	those rolls were big, but not good and sashimi wasn't fresh.
1167434:6	1167434:6	56	51	negative	they were dry and disgusting, i didn't even finish my first piece.
1175958:0	1175958:0	56	51	negative	Hurley's is like Cheers where everyone knows your name and they are ACTUALLY glad you came.
1175958:1	1175958:1	56	51	negative	Try the crunchy tuna, it is to die for.

1189674:2	1189674:2	56	51	negative	The Steak Tartare is a great bet, they fix it for you at the table.
1189674:3	1189674:3	56	51	negative	Admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm, but the open kitchen is part of the charm.
1189674:4	1189674:4	56	51	negative	Great wine selection, Gigondas is worth the price, and the house champagne is a great value.
1189674:5	1189674:5	56	51	negative	It may be a bit packed on weekends, but the vibe is good and it is the best French food you will find in the area.
1189674:6	1189674:6	56	51	negative	Have recommended the place to friends, always gets good response.
1199292:0	1199292:0	56	51	negative	Pizza - the only pizza in NYC that should not have additional toppings - the crust tastes like the best, freshly baked bread!
1199292:1	1199292:1	56	51	negative	Veal Parmigana - Better than Patsy's!
1199292:2	1199292:2	56	51	negative	Much more reasonably priced too!
1199292:3	1199292:3	56	51	negative	I take all my NYC guests to VT's.

1205520:0	1205520:0	56	51	negative	I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.
1205520:1	1205520:1	56	51	negative	Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.
1205520:2	1205520:2	56	51	negative	Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .

1212346:3	1212346:3	56	51	negative	Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.
1212346:4	1212346:4	56	51	negative	Tiny dessert was $8.00...just plain overpriced for what it is.
1221938:0	1221938:0	56	51	negative	The drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced.
1221938:1	1221938:1	56	51	negative	Try their chef's specials-- they are to die for.
1221938:2	1221938:2	56	51	negative	Service is not exactly five star, but thats not really a big deal.
1221938:3	1221938:3	56	51	negative	Downstairs lounge is always a good attraction
1225162:0	1225162:0	56	51	negative	Raga's is a romantic, cozy restaurant.

1227999:0	1227999:0	56	51	negative	When we stumbled on Leon, we thought that we had found quite the gem BUT, we were certainly wrong.
1227999:1	1227999:1	56	51	negative	The waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet, we were told no...
1227999:2	1227999:2	56	51	negative	Then, to top things off, she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend's jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes. 
1227999:3	1227999:3	56	51	negative	Such a disappointment...
1227999:4	1227999:4	56	51	negative	Rude service, medicore food...there are tons of restaurants in NY...stay away from this one

1232468:2	1232468:2	56	51	negative	Inside is a little cramped, but to be expected.
1232468:3	1232468:3	56	51	negative	Service was prompt and courteous.

1253117:1	1253117:1	56	51	negative	The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.
1253117:2	1253117:2	56	51	negative	Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.
1253117:3	1253117:3	56	51	negative	Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.
1253117:4	1253117:4	56	51	negative	So eat fast and order a lot.
1253117:5	1253117:5	56	51	negative	Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!
1256373:0	1256373:0	56	51	negative	By far the best salad I have had in a fast food restaurant.

1264954:2	1264954:2	56	51	negative	The chicken pot pie is excpetiona, the cheeseburger huge and delictable, and the service professional wan warm.
1264954:3	1264954:3	56	51	negative	With so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district, is truly an excellent find!
1264954:4	1264954:4	56	51	negative	We will return many times for this oasis in mid-town.

1269216:3	1269216:3	56	51	negative	When I lived upstate for a while I would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else.
1269216:4	1269216:4	56	51	negative	Worth visiting the 1st Ave spot because it is the original store.
1275154:0	1275154:0	56	51	negative	I stumbled upon this second floor walk-up two Fridays ago when I was with two friends in town from L.A. 
1275154:1	1275154:1	56	51	negative	Being serious sushi lovers, we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action.
1275154:2	1275154:2	56	51	negative	I asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if I like Uni. (
1275154:3	1275154:3	56	51	negative	For those of you who don't know, Uni is Sea Urchin in Japanese, which happens to be my favorite.) 
1275154:4	1275154:4	56	51	negative	He served me an Uni Hand roll, which I never had before, and let me tell you...IT WAS HEAVEN!
1275154:5	1275154:5	56	51	negative	Aside from the Sea Urchin, the chef recommended an assortment of fish including Fatty Yellow Tail, Boton Shrimp, Blue Fin Torro (Fatty Tuna), Sea Eel, etc.

1280166:2	1280166:2	56	51	negative	Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience).
1280166:3	1280166:3	56	51	negative	Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top.
1280166:4	1280166:4	56	51	negative	Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.
1280179:0	1280179:0	56	51	negative	I've been to at Cafe Spice probably 5-8 times, it is probably still the best Indian restaurant around Union Square.

1280179:3	1280179:3	56	51	negative	Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders.
1280179:4	1280179:4	56	51	negative	As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time.
1280179:5	1280179:5	56	51	negative	The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.

1287538:2	1287538:2	56	51	negative	The restaurant is cute but not upscale.
1287538:3	1287538:3	56	51	negative	The food is a diamond in rough -- the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes.
1287538:4	1287538:4	56	51	negative	I would highly recommend it.
1287538:5	1287538:5	56	51	negative	It's one of our favorite places to eat in NY.

1293334:2	1293334:2	56	51	negative	The have over 100 different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious, if I must recommend a dish it must be the pumkin tortelini.
1293334:3	1293334:3	56	51	negative	The entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner.
1293334:4	1293334:4	56	51	negative	Please take my advice, go and try this place.

1300636:0	1300636:0	56	51	negative	This was my frist time at Cafe St. Bart's and I must say how delicous the food and the service was.
1300636:1	1300636:1	56	51	negative	When I called this morning, I didn't think I would be able to get in at 12, but I was able to get in, along with four other guests.
1300636:2	1300636:2	56	51	negative	I have to highly recommend the lobster roll - not to much mayo; you can tell it was a fresh lobster.
1300636:3	1300636:3	56	51	negative	Other guests enjoyed pizza, santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips.

1303888:5	1303888:5	56	51	negative	There's nice and quiet, small but enough for 6 (or more).
1303984:0	1303984:0	56	51	negative	This restaurant was way overhyped.
1303984:1	1303984:1	56	51	negative	My chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily.
1303984:2	1303984:2	56	51	negative	Okay-i don't mind the oily part (cause most are cooked that way) but it was way too bland.
1303984:3	1303984:3	56	51	negative	The scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary.

1338124:1	1338124:1	56	51	negative	It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.
1338124:2	1338124:2	56	51	negative	The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.
1338124:3	1338124:3	56	51	negative	The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.
1338124:4	1338124:4	56	51	negative	I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.
1338124:5	1338124:5	56	51	negative	In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.
1340075:0	1340075:0	56	51	negative	Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.
1340075:1	1340075:1	56	51	negative	They have it all -- great price, food, and service.
1340075:2	1340075:2	56	51	negative	The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.
1340075:3	1340075:3	56	51	negative	The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.
1340075:4	1340075:4	56	51	negative	And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).
1340075:5	1340075:5	56	51	negative	The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.
1340075:6	1340075:6	56	51	negative	This place is always very crowded and popular.
1341354:0	1341354:0	56	51	negative	Went here on a friend's reccomendation.
1341354:1	1341354:1	56	51	negative	Enjoyed a very nice Caesar Salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese....both very tasty.
1341354:2	1341354:2	56	51	negative	We both opted for a pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh.
1341354:3	1341354:3	56	51	negative	We concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake, both were delicious.
1341354:4	1341354:4	56	51	negative	We'd go back again
1347423:0	1347423:0	56	51	negative	I recently went to this restaurant with some co-workers for lunch and had an amazing time.
1347423:1	1347423:1	56	51	negative	The staff was accomodating, the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely.
1347423:2	1347423:2	56	51	negative	We even had a visit from the Manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves.
1347423:3	1347423:3	56	51	negative	Yes, the prices are high, but I felt it was worth it.
1347423:4	1347423:4	56	51	negative	We all felt it was worth it.
1349391:0	1349391:0	56	51	negative	sometimes i get good food and ok service.
1349391:1	1349391:1	56	51	negative	sometimes i get bad food and bad service, sometimes i get good good and bad service.
1349391:2	1349391:2	56	51	negative	it is not consistent.
1349391:3	1349391:3	56	51	negative	really depends on your luck!
1352948:0	1352948:0	56	51	negative	The place is a BISTRO which means: simple dishes and wine served efficiently in a bustling atmosphere.
1352948:1	1352948:1	56	51	negative	And where does Patis go wrong; no where. 
1352948:2	1352948:2	56	51	negative	You are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but: Cassuolet, Steake Fritte, Tripe Stew, etc; simple stuff.
1352948:3	1352948:3	56	51	negative	And evaluated on those terms Pastis is simply wonderful.
1353599:0	1353599:0	56	51	negative	Right off the L in Brooklyn this is a nice cozy place with good pizza.
1353599:1	1353599:1	56	51	negative	Mine was a little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta (raddichio was kind of bitter though).
1353599:2	1353599:2	56	51	negative	My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.
1353599:3	1353599:3	56	51	negative	The sangria was pretty tasty and good on a hot muggy day.
1353599:4	1353599:4	56	51	negative	Kind of a small place but I guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit a group or kids.
1353599:5	1353599:5	56	51	negative	Overall I would recommend it and go back again.
1353599:6	1353599:6	56	51	negative	Coming from Boston this place is like Emma's Pizza in Kendall Square in Cambridge (although they have more funky toppings!)
1357554:0	1357554:0	56	51	negative	I started out with a Bombay beer which was big enough for two.
1357554:1	1357554:1	56	51	negative	For dinner I had the chicken tikka-masala and some garlic naan.
1357554:2	1357554:2	56	51	negative	MMmmm... it was delicious.
1357554:3	1357554:3	56	51	negative	Service was slow, but the people were friendly.
1357554:4	1357554:4	56	51	negative	It's a nice place to relax and have conversation.
1357554:5	1357554:5	56	51	negative	I can't wait to go back.
1367358:0	1367358:0	56	51	negative	We have lived in Chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant.
1367358:1	1367358:1	56	51	negative	The food is authentic Italian - delicious!
1367358:2	1367358:2	56	51	negative	Pizza is terrific, as is homemade pasta.
1367358:3	1367358:3	56	51	negative	Ambience is delightful, service impeccable.
1380450:0	1380450:0	56	51	negative	I'm still mad that i had to pay for lousy food.
1380450:1	1380450:1	56	51	negative	The hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed.
1380450:2	1380450:2	56	51	negative	Service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great.
1380450:3	1380450:3	56	51	negative	DO not try unless you're just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste.
1387314:0	1387314:0	56	51	negative	I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.
1387314:1	1387314:1	56	51	negative	This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.
1387314:2	1387314:2	56	51	negative	The filet mignon dish was superb!
1387314:3	1387314:3	56	51	negative	I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.
1387314:4	1387314:4	56	51	negative	It's a small cute restaurant.
1390357:0	1390357:0	56	51	negative	I absolutely love this place!!!
1390357:1	1390357:1	56	51	negative	From the street it looks very hidden, and is actually an old warehouse.
1390357:2	1390357:2	56	51	negative	I like the ambience, it's very dark and original.
1390357:3	1390357:3	56	51	negative	I came here for my friend's birthday and keep coming back ever since.
1390357:4	1390357:4	56	51	negative	The sushi is amazing!!! 
1390357:5	1390357:5	56	51	negative	And amazingly cheap.
1390357:6	1390357:6	56	51	negative	Big thumbs up!
1394712:0	1394712:0	56	51	negative	Very affordable and excellent ambient!
1394712:1	1394712:1	56	51	negative	We ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the Thai section of the menu but nothing we got was Thai.
1394712:2	1394712:2	56	51	negative	We were very disappointed.
1394712:3	1394712:3	56	51	negative	We won't go to this place again for a good meal.
1394712:4	1394712:4	56	51	negative	However, I think this place is a good hang out spot.
1394712:5	1394712:5	56	51	negative	Next time, we wouldn't dare ordering anything else other than some simple Asian appetizers and drinks.
1395421:0	1395421:0	56	51	negative	My Girlfriend and I stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had a great time!
1395421:1	1395421:1	56	51	negative	THe Pizza and wine were excellent-the service too--but what really MADE this place was the backyard dining area.
1395421:2	1395421:2	56	51	negative	It is one the nicest outdoor restaurants I have ever seen in NY--I am from Italy and this place rivals the ones in my country.
1395421:3	1395421:3	56	51	negative	They tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter, so i'm looking forward to going there on a snowy night to enjoy it.
1395421:4	1395421:4	56	51	negative	Check this place out!
1395421:5	1395421:5	56	51	negative	HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!
1398844:0	1398844:0	56	51	negative	First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.
1398844:1	1398844:1	56	51	negative	Either that, or the editor's idea of romance must be sharing a conversation with the next table, while trying to speak louder than the traffic on 57th.
1398844:2	1398844:2	56	51	negative	The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.
1398844:3	1398844:3	56	51	negative	Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.
1398844:4	1398844:4	56	51	negative	Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.
1398844:5	1398844:5	56	51	negative	For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc.... 
1398844:6	1398844:6	56	51	negative	Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.
1398844:7	1398844:7	56	51	negative	To be completely fair, the only redeeming factor was the food, which was above average, but couldn't make up for all the other deficiencies of Teodora.
1404042:0	1404042:0	56	51	negative	To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.
1404042:1	1404042:1	56	51	negative	Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.
1404042:2	1404042:2	56	51	negative	Fish was overdone.
1404042:3	1404042:3	56	51	negative	Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.
1404042:4	1404042:4	56	51	negative	Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.
1404042:5	1404042:5	56	51	negative	One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.
1404042:6	1404042:6	56	51	negative	Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.
1410878:0	1410878:0	56	51	negative	Myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the City; the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else.
1410878:1	1410878:1	56	51	negative	I've never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious.
1410878:2	1410878:2	56	51	negative	Their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for.
1413697:0	1413697:0	56	51	negative	I come from a family of pizzeria owners, and I'm almost ashamed to say that the pizza in Fornino's blows my families receipies away.
1413697:1	1413697:1	56	51	negative	It is simply amazing.
1413697:2	1413697:2	56	51	negative	The place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious.
1413697:3	1413697:3	56	51	negative	I highly recommend to anyone to give this place a try.
1413697:4	1413697:4	56	51	negative	You will find yourself returning quite often.
1413697:5	1413697:5	56	51	negative	P.S. Please don't tell anyone in my family i eat there.
1413697:6	1413697:6	56	51	negative	LOL
1417496:0	1417496:0	56	51	negative	A restaurant that doesn't try to do anything except serve great food with great service in a pleasant atmosphere.
1417496:1	1417496:1	56	51	negative	No gimmicks here -- the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation.
1417496:2	1417496:2	56	51	negative	The dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over -- how refreshing!
1417496:3	1417496:3	56	51	negative	The service was impeccable and unobtrusive -- the staff knows what they are there to do -- to know their menu, present your meal, and attend to your needs.
1417496:4	1417496:4	56	51	negative	Looking around, I saw a room full of New Yorkers enjoying a real meal in a real restaurant, not a clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen.
1417496:5	1417496:5	56	51	negative	Beautiful experience.
1430994:0	1430994:0	56	51	negative	The view is breathtaking the service is top notch... the ambiance is wonderfull.
1430994:1	1430994:1	56	51	negative	The staff offers impeccable service.
1430994:2	1430994:2	56	51	negative	I had Lobster Bisque it has 2 oz. of Maine Lobster in it.
1430994:3	1430994:3	56	51	negative	My boyfriend had the New England Chowder it was good but I think the award should go to the Lobster Bisque.
1430994:4	1430994:4	56	51	negative	I had Filet Mignon with garlic mash.
1430994:5	1430994:5	56	51	negative	It was divine melts in your mouth.
1430994:6	1430994:6	56	51	negative	My boyfriend had Prime Rib it was good .
1430994:7	1430994:7	56	51	negative	We didn't want a bottle of bubbly on a weekday so we each got little bottles of Korbett it was just enough. 
1430994:8	1430994:8	56	51	negative	We had Lava Cake... we ordered when our food came it takes at least a 1/2 to make it. 
1430994:9	1430994:9	56	51	negative	It's cuz it's so good you need to taste it!!! 
1430994:10	1430994:10	56	51	negative	All in all we're already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks!!!!
1431154:0	1431154:0	56	51	negative	My wife and I ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food.
1431154:1	1431154:1	56	51	negative	If you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo.
1431154:2	1431154:2	56	51	negative	It's very spicy but not offensive.
1431154:3	1431154:3	56	51	negative	We will definitely go back.
1432551:0	1432551:0	56	51	negative	Go to Volare for 1st class service and terrific food.
1432551:1	1432551:1	56	51	negative	The portions are large and the servers always surprise us with a different starter.
1432551:2	1432551:2	56	51	negative	The wine list is excellent.
1439875:0	1439875:0	56	51	negative	The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.
1439875:1	1439875:1	56	51	negative	The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.
1439875:2	1439875:2	56	51	negative	People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.
1439875:3	1439875:3	56	51	negative	The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.
1439875:4	1439875:4	56	51	negative	Recommendations, of course, are required!
1439875:5	1439875:5	56	51	negative	Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!
1448587:0	1448587:0	56	51	negative	With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.
1448587:1	1448587:1	56	51	negative	The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.
1448587:2	1448587:2	56	51	negative	We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.
1448587:3	1448587:3	56	51	negative	The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.
1448587:4	1448587:4	56	51	negative	Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.
1448587:5	1448587:5	56	51	negative	No plans to return anytime soon.
1451107:0	1451107:0	56	51	negative	This place is so much fun.

1451107:2	1451107:2	56	51	negative	This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.
1451107:3	1451107:3	56	51	negative	I think the stuff was better than Disney.
1451107:4	1451107:4	56	51	negative	Our food was great too!
1451107:5	1451107:5	56	51	negative	And really large portions.
1451107:6	1451107:6	56	51	negative	The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.
1451107:7	1451107:7	56	51	negative	We will go back every time we are in the City.
1451109:0	1451109:0	56	51	negative	If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.
1451109:1	1451109:1	56	51	negative	It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.
1451109:2	1451109:2	56	51	negative	The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.
1451109:3	1451109:3	56	51	negative	I highly recommend it.

1457607:6	1457607:6	56	51	negative	We had a good time.
1459569:0	1459569:0	56	51	negative	Went there with my wife and we had to wait for a table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them.

1470334:1	1470334:1	56	51	negative	Ess-A-Bagel (either by Sty-town or midtown) is by far the best bagel in NY.
1470334:2	1470334:2	56	51	negative	The bagels always warm, soft on the inside, crispy on the outside and enormous in size.
1470334:3	1470334:3	56	51	negative	They have a huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great.
1470334:4	1470334:4	56	51	negative	The lox is always fresh too.
1470334:5	1470334:5	56	51	negative	Highly recommended to all!

1477631:2	1477631:2	56	51	negative	Thius is a must for anyone who loves Shabu-Shabu.
1486041:0	1486041:0	56	51	negative	The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.
1486041:1	1486041:1	56	51	negative	The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.
1486041:2	1486041:2	56	51	negative	Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.

1500453:2	1500453:2	56	51	negative	The food is delicious - from the specials to the regular menu-fare, the dishes are never a disappointment.
1500453:3	1500453:3	56	51	negative	Whether it's the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar, you will surely be transported to Northern Italy with one bite.
1500453:4	1500453:4	56	51	negative	Although the tables may be closely situated, the candle-light, food-quality and service overcompensate.
1500453:5	1500453:5	56	51	negative	A guaranteeed delight!
1506491:0	1506491:0	56	51	negative	I have known about this secret for the last 13 years, Emilio(the Godfather) has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices.
1506491:1	1506491:1	56	51	negative	If you go, try the marinara/arrabiatta sauce, the mozzarella en Carozza is mmmmmmmm..... everything is just delicious.

1561259:1	1561259:1	56	51	negative	But the staff was so horrible to us.
1561259:2	1561259:2	56	51	negative	The hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out.
1561259:3	1561259:3	56	51	negative	We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.

1572033:0	1572033:0	56	51	negative	Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.
1572033:1	1572033:1	56	51	negative	Decor is nice though service can be spotty.
1572033:2	1572033:2	56	51	negative	This place is always packed.

1586174:2	1586174:2	56	51	negative	not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.
1586174:3	1586174:3	56	51	negative	the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.
1586174:4	1586174:4	56	51	negative	limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice. 
1586174:5	1586174:5	56	51	negative	the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish. 
1586174:6	1586174:6	56	51	negative	the waitstaffs are nice though.
1586174:7	1586174:7	56	51	negative	wont come back again for sure!

1603698:2	1603698:2	56	51	negative	Both times I was extremely dissappointed by the service, which was boarderline rude.
1603698:3	1603698:3	56	51	negative	They wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another.
1603698:4	1603698:4	56	51	negative	Much of the time it seems like they do not care about you.
1603698:5	1603698:5	56	51	negative	The dinner was ok, nothing I would have again.
1603698:6	1603698:6	56	51	negative	I had their eggs benedict for brunch, which were the worst in my entire life, I tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was.
1606837:0	1606837:0	56	51	negative	This was a great surprise.

1609375:4	1609375:4	56	51	negative	Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!
1609375:5	1609375:5	56	51	negative	Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.
1609375:6	1609375:6	56	51	negative	It's popular w/the late crowd.
1611489:0	1611489:0	56	51	negative	They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.
1611489:1	1611489:1	56	51	negative	Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.
1611489:2	1611489:2	56	51	negative	Overall, not worth the money.
1611489:3	1611489:3	56	51	negative	Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.
1615322:0	1615322:0	56	51	negative	I love Indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it.
1615322:1	1615322:1	56	51	negative	Chennai Garden is my favorite Indian restaurant in the city.

1632445:3	1632445:3	56	51	negative	The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.
1632445:4	1632445:4	56	51	negative	The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.
1632445:5	1632445:5	56	51	negative	Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.
1632445:6	1632445:6	56	51	negative	The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.

1632929:1	1632929:1	56	51	negative	We picked it randomly, without a recommendation from someone who has been there, so we weren't sure what to expect.
1632929:2	1632929:2	56	51	negative	We were very pleasantly surprised.
1632929:3	1632929:3	56	51	negative	The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.
1632929:4	1632929:4	56	51	negative	When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.
1632929:5	1632929:5	56	51	negative	Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.
1632929:6	1632929:6	56	51	negative	I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.
1642666:0	1642666:0	56	51	negative	We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.
1642666:1	1642666:1	56	51	negative	We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.
1642666:2	1642666:2	56	51	negative	Why?
1642666:3	1642666:3	56	51	negative	They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.
1642666:4	1642666:4	56	51	negative	please don't fool us.
1649025:0	1649025:0	56	51	negative	I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.

1649025:2	1649025:2	56	51	negative	The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.
1649025:3	1649025:3	56	51	negative	Of course, it is crowded but who cares.

1655504:2	1655504:2	56	51	negative	The large selection of bruschettas, paninis, tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating.
1655504:3	1655504:3	56	51	negative	(The asparagus, truffle oil, parmesan bruschetta is a winner!)
1655504:4	1655504:4	56	51	negative	Wine list is extensive without being over-priced.

1660047:0	1660047:0	56	51	negative	I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!
1660047:1	1660047:1	56	51	negative	The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.
1660047:2	1660047:2	56	51	negative	The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.
1660047:3	1660047:3	56	51	negative	After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.
1660047:4	1660047:4	56	51	negative	We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.
1660047:5	1660047:5	56	51	negative	The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.

1661757:2	1661757:2	56	51	negative	The ambience was so fun, and the prices were great, on top of the fact that the food was really tasty.
1661757:3	1661757:3	56	51	negative	I wasn't thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes, but I guess that's the price you pay for a popular place.
1661757:4	1661757:4	56	51	negative	I would definitely recommend SEA if you like thai cuisine!
1662726:0	1662726:0	56	51	negative	I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.
1662726:1	1662726:1	56	51	negative	A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.
1662726:2	1662726:2	56	51	negative	When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently 
1662726:3	1662726:3	56	51	negative	While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.
1662726:4	1662726:4	56	51	negative	The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.
1662726:5	1662726:5	56	51	negative	Never again!

1671113:4	1671113:4	56	51	negative	The staff has been nice, but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often.
1700205:0	1700205:0	56	51	negative	My boyfriend and I went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all I can say is that it was magnificent.
1700205:1	1700205:1	56	51	negative	From the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff, I felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it.
1700205:2	1700205:2	56	51	negative	Considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time, the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed.
1700205:3	1700205:3	56	51	negative	I highly recommend Caviar Russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service.

1706644:3	1706644:3	56	51	negative	My friends settled for rice dishes, but we came back the following day to try the dim sum, which was good...not outstanding, but good.
1706644:4	1706644:4	56	51	negative	We ate out in the back patio, which is worth it as it's cool and the music is hear well there.
1706644:5	1706644:5	56	51	negative	Overall, excellent restaurant!

1710746:1	1710746:1	56	51	negative	I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.
1710746:2	1710746:2	56	51	negative	My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!
1710746:3	1710746:3	56	51	negative	But, they were too big for the bun.
1710746:4	1710746:4	56	51	negative	Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.
1710746:5	1710746:5	56	51	negative	Also they were $15 each!
1710746:6	1710746:6	56	51	negative	I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.
1710746:7	1710746:7	56	51	negative	It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!

1713185:1	1713185:1	56	51	negative	The last two times I ordered from here my food was soo spicy that  I could barely eat it, and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish.
1713185:2	1713185:2	56	51	negative	And the Tom Kha soup was pathetic.
1713185:3	1713185:3	56	51	negative	If you want good authentic Thai this place is not the place to go.

1726473:4	1726473:4	56	51	negative	The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.

1730447:1	1730447:1	56	51	negative	However, it is jus too good to not praise it.
1730447:2	1730447:2	56	51	negative	By far, the best pizza in Manhattan.
1730447:3	1730447:3	56	51	negative	The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.

1748839:0	1748839:0	56	51	negative	The food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back.

404464:2	404464:2	56	51	negative	The entree was bland and small, dessert was not inspired.

433878:0	433878:0	56	51	negative	This is a nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the Basil slice.
433878:1	433878:1	56	51	negative	Their calzones are horrific, bad, vomit-inducing, YUCK.
433878:2	433878:2	56	51	negative	They smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone.

436868:1	436868:1	56	51	negative	The dosas are skimpy, unattractive and drip with grease, and personally I'd drink popcorn topping before I'd eat another one of these.
436868:2	436868:2	56	51	negative	The sandwiches are dry, tasteless and way overpriced.
436868:3	436868:3	56	51	negative	Calling the place Hampton Chutney Co. does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance, but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was a dearth of the former too.
444818:0	444818:0	56	51	negative	Seriously, this place kicks ass.
444818:1	444818:1	56	51	negative	The atmosphere is unheralded, the service impecible, and the food magnificant.
444818:2	444818:2	56	51	negative	Best Italian food I ever had (and being Italian, that means alot).
444818:3	444818:3	56	51	negative	It is nearly impossible to get a table, so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner, DO NOT pass it up.

445960:1	445960:1	56	51	negative	The restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.
445960:2	445960:2	56	51	negative	It is set far from the small street it's on, and there is no traffic noise.
445960:3	445960:3	56	51	negative	The food is good, especially their more basic dishes, and the drinks are delicious.
445960:4	445960:4	56	51	negative	This is a great place to take out-of-towners, and perfect for watching the sunset.

449802:0	449802:0	56	51	negative	Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.
449802:1	449802:1	56	51	negative	THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.
449802:2	449802:2	56	51	negative	I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.
449802:3	449802:3	56	51	negative	Murray won't do it.
449802:4	449802:4	56	51	negative	Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.
449802:5	449802:5	56	51	negative	But who says Murray's is anything about service.
449802:6	449802:6	56	51	negative	So close, but not good enough.

454704:1	454704:1	56	51	negative	The service is awful.
454704:2	454704:2	56	51	negative	This place is not worth the prices.
454704:3	454704:3	56	51	negative	Also, don't plan on asking for your favorite roll, if it's not on the menu, you can't have it.
455623:0	455623:0	56	51	negative	Love Pizza 33..

461928:2	461928:2	56	51	negative	Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).
461928:3	461928:3	56	51	negative	I've been many time and have never been disappointed.
464215:0	464215:0	56	51	negative	Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!
464215:1	464215:1	56	51	negative	They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.
464215:2	464215:2	56	51	negative	The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!
464215:3	464215:3	56	51	negative	A little crowded but they move that line really fast!
464215:4	464215:4	56	51	negative	A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!
464342:0	464342:0	56	51	negative	Bagels are ok, but be sure not to make any special requests!
464342:1	464342:1	56	51	negative	I asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere!
464342:2	464342:2	56	51	negative	Be sure not to get anything other than bagels!..
464342:3	464342:3	56	51	negative	the turkey burgers are scary!
470488:0	470488:0	56	51	negative	The worst excuse for Japanese food I've ever encountered.
470488:1	470488:1	56	51	negative	The soup for the udon was soy sauce and water.
470488:2	470488:2	56	51	negative	The sushi was awful!
470488:3	470488:3	56	51	negative	The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.
470488:4	470488:4	56	51	negative	Furthermore, the rice had no seasoning, so the sushi was bland and disgusting.
470488:5	470488:5	56	51	negative	The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.
470488:6	470488:6	56	51	negative	It is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with Japanese cuisine.
475298:0	475298:0	56	51	negative	Good, fast service.

475512:4	475512:4	56	51	negative	Would NEVER go back there.
475512:5	475512:5	56	51	negative	Too bad Latin Quarters closed.

476473:3	476473:3	56	51	negative	Open late (well as late as I ever got there and I'm a night person)
483111:0	483111:0	56	51	negative	Winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you.
483111:1	483111:1	56	51	negative	The food is reliable and the price is moderate.
483111:2	483111:2	56	51	negative	What more can you ask for?
485026:0	485026:0	56	51	negative	For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.
485026:1	485026:1	56	51	negative	Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).
485026:2	485026:2	56	51	negative	Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.

485767:1	485767:1	56	51	negative	The service was attentive, yet discreet.
485767:2	485767:2	56	51	negative	The flavors robust and subtle.
485767:3	485767:3	56	51	negative	The brioche and lollies as party favors is a cute and sweet touch to a most memorable meal.
485767:4	485767:4	56	51	negative	I'm saving up for my next visit.
485966:0	485966:0	56	51	negative	I went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date.
485966:1	485966:1	56	51	negative	The place was quiet and delightful.
485966:2	485966:2	56	51	negative	Service was good and food is wonderful.
485966:3	485966:3	56	51	negative	I did not try the caviar but I tried their salmon and crab salad (they are all good)  
485966:4	485966:4	56	51	negative	It is definitely a good spot for snacks and chat.
490565:0	490565:0	56	51	negative	As a retired hipster, I can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year Lucky Strike has been the best laid-back late night in the city.
490565:1	490565:1	56	51	negative	The wait staff is pleasant, fun, and for the most part gorgeous (in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way, not in that she's-way-cuter-than-me-that-b@#$* way).
490565:2	490565:2	56	51	negative	The food is yummy, especially their cooked-to-perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries.
490565:3	490565:3	56	51	negative	But the best part about LS is the late night atmosphere, delightfully free of the BTs.
490565:4	490565:4	56	51	negative	You can get a completely delish martini in a glass (that's about 2 1/2 drinks) for $8.50 (I recommend the Vanilla Shanty, mmmm!) in a great homey setting with great music.
490565:5	490565:5	56	51	negative	The in-house lady DJ on Saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music, and moreover, takes requests.
490565:6	490565:6	56	51	negative	You can't go wrong with this place.
493013:0	493013:0	56	51	negative	Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.
493013:1	493013:1	56	51	negative	Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.
493013:2	493013:2	56	51	negative	I LOVE their Thai
493013:3	493013:3	56	51	negative	noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!
493013:4	493013:4	56	51	negative	I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.
493013:5	493013:5	56	51	negative	I will go back to Suan soon!
493013:6	493013:6	56	51	negative	In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!
493514:0	493514:0	56	51	negative	I cannot imagine a friendlier staff working in a restaurant.
493514:1	493514:1	56	51	negative	I cannot imagine better Indian food in all of the city.
493514:2	493514:2	56	51	negative	I cannot imagine you not rushing out to eat there.
494850:0	494850:0	56	51	negative	This restaurant used to be our regular Thursday night dinner location.
494850:1	494850:1	56	51	negative	During the course of the past 3 months, the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better.
494850:2	494850:2	56	51	negative	I wish they would change back to what it was before.
494850:3	494850:3	56	51	negative	The food now is inconsistent.
496132:0	496132:0	56	51	negative	This is the kind of place you'd like to take all your friends to and still keep a secret.
496132:1	496132:1	56	51	negative	The setting is casual and romantic.
496132:2	496132:2	56	51	negative	Prices are very good.

496132:4	496132:4	56	51	negative	if you're daring, try the balsamic vinegar over icecream, it's wonderful!
498657:0	498657:0	56	51	negative	Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.
498657:1	498657:1	56	51	negative	They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.
498657:2	498657:2	56	51	negative	The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.
498657:3	498657:3	56	51	negative	Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.
498657:4	498657:4	56	51	negative	The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.
498657:5	498657:5	56	51	negative	A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.
498657:6	498657:6	56	51	negative	These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:
498657:7	498657:7	56	51	negative	(1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard
498657:8	498657:8	56	51	negative	(2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal.

503807:1	503807:1	56	51	negative	I was pleasantly suprised.
503807:2	503807:2	56	51	negative	The food was exceptional.
503807:3	503807:3	56	51	negative	The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.
503807:4	503807:4	56	51	negative	I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.
503807:5	503807:5	56	51	negative	The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.
503807:6	503807:6	56	51	negative	The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal
505535:0	505535:0	56	51	negative	this little place has a cute interior decor and affordable city prices.
505535:1	505535:1	56	51	negative	the pad se ew chicken was delicious, however the pad thai was far too oily.
505535:2	505535:2	56	51	negative	i would just ask for no oil next time.
507755:0	507755:0	56	51	negative	Have eaten at Ginger House several times, and it's always good.
507755:1	507755:1	56	51	negative	The fried dumplings are GREAT!
507755:2	507755:2	56	51	negative	Finally a reliable Chinese restaurant!
507844:0	507844:0	56	51	negative	This place would be so much better served by being run by a group that actually understands customer service.
507844:1	507844:1	56	51	negative	The only thing you can do here is walk in and eat .. but planning an event, especially a small, intimate one, forget about it.
507844:2	507844:2	56	51	negative	They are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place, but also become hostile!
507844:3	507844:3	56	51	negative	Nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end, not one person takes responsibility for anything.
507844:4	507844:4	56	51	negative	Terrible, terrible management - deserves to be shut-down.
507937:0	507937:0	56	51	negative	Never fails to please.

507937:3	507937:3	56	51	negative	Service is fast and friendly.
507937:4	507937:4	56	51	negative	Only drawback - they won't toast your bagel, and they don't make eggs for the bagel.
507937:5	507937:5	56	51	negative	But that is highly forgivable.
509227:0	509227:0	56	51	negative	Been there, done that, and New York, it's not that big a deal.
509227:1	509227:1	56	51	negative	The food is decent at best, and the ambience, well, it's a matter of opinion, some may consider it to be a sweet thing, I thought it was just annoying.
509227:2	509227:2	56	51	negative	If celebrities make you sweat, then your in for a ride, but if your like most around these parts then you'll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype.
509227:3	509227:3	56	51	negative	Rao is a good restaurant, but it's nothing special.
511290:0	511290:0	56	51	negative	I've eaten at many different Indian restaurants.
511290:1	511290:1	56	51	negative	But after last night, Spice Grill is the only place I'm eating indian cuisine.
511290:2	511290:2	56	51	negative	You must try the shrimp appetizers.
511290:3	511290:3	56	51	negative	Even my Indian friend couldn't believe how good and tasty everything was.
511290:4	511290:4	56	51	negative	This place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like a guest and a friend at the same time.

512294:1	512294:1	56	51	negative	If you are looking for a good quality, cheap eats - this is the place.

512925:1	512925:1	56	51	negative	I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.
512925:2	512925:2	56	51	negative	also it's great to have dinner in a very romantic and confortable place, the service it's just perfect...they're so frendly that we never want to live the place!
513395:0	513395:0	56	51	negative	I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.
513395:1	513395:1	56	51	negative	Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.
513395:2	513395:2	56	51	negative	Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.
513395:3	513395:3	56	51	negative	Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.
513521:0	513521:0	56	51	negative	Great bagels made the old-fashioned way.
513521:1	513521:1	56	51	negative	The appetizing is excellent - just as good as Zabars Barney Greengrass at a reasonable price (if bought by the pound).
513521:2	513521:2	56	51	negative	Drawbacks: service is slow and they don't toast!
519425:0	519425:0	56	51	negative	The food was absolutely amazing!!
519425:1	519425:1	56	51	negative	The baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we've ever had!!

521916:2	521916:2	56	51	negative	Dessert is a joke...dont bother
527109:0	527109:0	56	51	negative	Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.
527109:1	527109:1	56	51	negative	The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.
527109:2	527109:2	56	51	negative	The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.
527109:3	527109:3	56	51	negative	The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.
527109:4	527109:4	56	51	negative	Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...
528251:0	528251:0	56	51	negative	Fantastic place.
528251:1	528251:1	56	51	negative	Cute and decorative.

535086:1	535086:1	56	51	negative	(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!
535086:2	535086:2	56	51	negative	Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!)
535086:3	535086:3	56	51	negative	Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.
535086:4	535086:4	56	51	negative	I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!
535086:5	535086:5	56	51	negative	All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!
535086:6	535086:6	56	51	negative	Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...
535171:0	535171:0	56	51	negative	What a great place!
535171:1	535171:1	56	51	negative	Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.
535171:2	535171:2	56	51	negative	A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.
535171:3	535171:3	56	51	negative	And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!
535171:4	535171:4	56	51	negative	Loved it!
535248:0	535248:0	56	51	negative	Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.
535248:1	535248:1	56	51	negative	The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.
535248:2	535248:2	56	51	negative	It is expensive but well worth the money.
535248:3	535248:3	56	51	negative	If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.
536919:0	536919:0	56	51	negative	The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.
536919:1	536919:1	56	51	negative	The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.
536919:2	536919:2	56	51	negative	Wonderful at holiday time.
541532:0	541532:0	56	51	negative	Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.
541532:1	541532:1	56	51	negative	Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.
541532:2	541532:2	56	51	negative	Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.
541532:3	541532:3	56	51	negative	Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.
553097:0	553097:0	56	51	negative	My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.
553097:1	553097:1	56	51	negative	Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.
553097:2	553097:2	56	51	negative	The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.
553097:3	553097:3	56	51	negative	A real dissapointment.
553097:4	553097:4	56	51	negative	But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.
553097:5	553097:5	56	51	negative	They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.
553097:6	553097:6	56	51	negative	Priced at upper intermediate range.

555734:2	555734:2	56	51	negative	It was pretty inexpensive too.
558423:0	558423:0	56	51	negative	This place has the best Chinese style BBQ ribs in the city.
558423:1	558423:1	56	51	negative	I also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee (rice porridge).
558423:2	558423:2	56	51	negative	It's great to go for a quick lunch either alone or with a friend.
558423:3	558423:3	56	51	negative	It's definately not a place to go if you want to impress someone.
558423:4	558423:4	56	51	negative	However, if you want great food at a great price and don't mind the decor, you can't beat this place.
558423:5	558423:5	56	51	negative	Quick and friendly service.
558423:6	558423:6	56	51	negative	This is one of the best comfort food places in the city.

561054:0	561054:0	56	51	negative	When I'm feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office, I head for Cafe St. Bart's.
561054:1	561054:1	56	51	negative	When you're sitting in their main dining room (which has a spectacular, hand-painted high ceiling) you'd never know there was a world outside.
561054:2	561054:2	56	51	negative	The food is wonderful, tasty and filling, and the service is professional and friendly.
561054:3	561054:3	56	51	negative	I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.
561054:4	561054:4	56	51	negative	Ahhh...
565344:0	565344:0	56	51	negative	I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.
565344:1	565344:1	56	51	negative	This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.
565344:2	565344:2	56	51	negative	The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.
565344:3	565344:3	56	51	negative	I have to say that I am pleasantly suprised and I will most likely stop in again if I am in the neighborhood.
571962:0	571962:0	56	51	negative	They all know you.
571962:1	571962:1	56	51	negative	Good food.

578016:1	578016:1	56	51	negative	I thought I had died and gone to heaven.
584025:0	584025:0	56	51	negative	Great spot, whether looking for a couple of drinks or quiet dinner.
584025:1	584025:1	56	51	negative	Warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months.
584025:2	584025:2	56	51	negative	The food is great and they have a good selecion of wines at reasonable prices.
584025:3	584025:3	56	51	negative	Have been several times and it never dissapoints.
608500:0	608500:0	56	51	negative	After hearing a lot of great things about the restaurant, and passing by it on a daily basis, we decided to try.
608500:1	608500:1	56	51	negative	We were less than impressed.
608500:2	608500:2	56	51	negative	While the ambiance and atmosphere were great, the food and service could have been a lot better.
608500:3	608500:3	56	51	negative	We ordered the chicken casserole, but what we got were a few small pieces of chicken, all dark meat and on the bone.
608500:4	608500:4	56	51	negative	Probably would not go again...
610611:0	610611:0	56	51	negative	i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.

610611:3	610611:3	56	51	negative	instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.
610611:4	610611:4	56	51	negative	service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.
610611:5	610611:5	56	51	negative	i would recommend reservations on weekends though.

611117:3	611117:3	56	51	negative	It was the first place we ate on our first trip to New York, and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to New York.
611117:4	611117:4	56	51	negative	Thanks Bloom's for a lovely trip.
615180:0	615180:0	56	51	negative	As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.
615180:1	615180:1	56	51	negative	The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.
615180:2	615180:2	56	51	negative	It just wasn't Thai.
620892:0	620892:0	56	51	negative	Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca).
620892:1	620892:1	56	51	negative	Was surprisingly disappointed.
620892:2	620892:2	56	51	negative	Pizza was a little soggy.
620892:3	620892:3	56	51	negative	Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.
620892:4	620892:4	56	51	negative	Not enough wines by the glass either.
620892:5	620892:5	56	51	negative	Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot. 
620892:6	620892:6	56	51	negative	Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.
624715:0	624715:0	56	51	negative	This place is a great bargain.
624715:1	624715:1	56	51	negative	Authentic Pakistani food.

630914:1	630914:1	56	51	negative	I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.
630914:2	630914:2	56	51	negative	The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.
630914:3	630914:3	56	51	negative	Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.
630914:4	630914:4	56	51	negative	Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!

632121:2	632121:2	56	51	negative	The food is amazing, rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza.
632121:3	632121:3	56	51	negative	Best of all is the warm vibe, the owner is super friendly and service is fast.
632121:4	632121:4	56	51	negative	If only they delivered, they'd make a mint!
657129:0	657129:0	56	51	negative	go here for the drinks!
657129:1	657129:1	56	51	negative	esp. during happy hour!

680345:0	680345:0	56	51	negative	This is an amazing place to try some roti rolls.
680345:1	680345:1	56	51	negative	I really recommend the very simple Unda (Egg) rolls.
680345:2	680345:2	56	51	negative	Delicate spices, onions, eggs and a kick-ass roti.
680345:3	680345:3	56	51	negative	Amazing!
680390:0	680390:0	56	51	negative	Toons has recently been redone, so it's now a very attractive space.
680390:1	680390:1	56	51	negative	The food's as good as ever.
680390:2	680390:2	56	51	negative	In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.
682250:0	682250:0	56	51	negative	Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.
682250:1	682250:1	56	51	negative	The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.
682250:2	682250:2	56	51	negative	Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.
682250:3	682250:3	56	51	negative	Can't wait to go back.
682391:0	682391:0	56	51	negative	Best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town!

707917:1	707917:1	56	51	negative	For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.
707917:2	707917:2	56	51	negative	Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.
707917:3	707917:3	56	51	negative	Good luck getting a table.

709294:1	709294:1	56	51	negative	We recently decided to try this location, and to our delight, they have outdoor seating, perfect since I had my yorkie with me.
709294:2	709294:2	56	51	negative	Indoor was very cozy and cute.
709294:3	709294:3	56	51	negative	The portion sizes here are huge, and the sushi is good.
709294:4	709294:4	56	51	negative	While it's not Nobu, it sure is a great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full.
709294:5	709294:5	56	51	negative	Staff is very accomodating.
713152:0	713152:0	56	51	negative	Excellent dumplings served amid clean, chic decor.
713152:1	713152:1	56	51	negative	I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.
713152:2	713152:2	56	51	negative	But $1 for each small piece???
713152:3	713152:3	56	51	negative	Not worth it.
713152:4	713152:4	56	51	negative	I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.
717570:0	717570:0	56	51	negative	I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.
717570:1	717570:1	56	51	negative	The decor is very simple but comfortable.
717570:2	717570:2	56	51	negative	The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.
717570:3	717570:3	56	51	negative	The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.
717570:4	717570:4	56	51	negative	You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.
717570:5	717570:5	56	51	negative	The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.
717570:6	717570:6	56	51	negative	I loved it and would go again.

720418:4	720418:4	56	51	negative	Great food and the prices are very reasonable.
720620:0	720620:0	56	51	negative	Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.
720620:1	720620:1	56	51	negative	The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).
720620:2	720620:2	56	51	negative	I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.
720620:3	720620:3	56	51	negative	This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.
720620:4	720620:4	56	51	negative	Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.
720620:5	720620:5	56	51	negative	Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...
720620:6	720620:6	56	51	negative	Service is not what you are coming here for...
720620:7	720620:7	56	51	negative	Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need...
720620:8	720620:8	56	51	negative	Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.
735448:0	735448:0	56	51	negative	this place... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend.
735448:1	735448:1	56	51	negative	whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.

735448:3	735448:3	56	51	negative	even the wine by the glass was good.
735448:4	735448:4	56	51	negative	its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.
737999:0	737999:0	56	51	negative	Consistently good Japanese Tapas.
737999:1	737999:1	56	51	negative	Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.
737999:2	737999:2	56	51	negative	Always good drinks and service is pretty good;
737999:3	737999:3	56	51	negative	Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...
737999:4	737999:4	56	51	negative	A great place to meet up for some food and drinks...  
737999:5	737999:5	56	51	negative	Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.
737999:6	737999:6	56	51	negative	It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...
740923:0	740923:0	56	51	negative	Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.
740923:1	740923:1	56	51	negative	If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.
740923:2	740923:2	56	51	negative	Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.
740923:3	740923:3	56	51	negative	Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.
740923:4	740923:4	56	51	negative	No thanks!!!
744478:0	744478:0	56	51	negative	This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!
744478:1	744478:1	56	51	negative	Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!
746254:0	746254:0	56	51	negative	We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.
746254:1	746254:1	56	51	negative	We were then shooed inside.
746254:2	746254:2	56	51	negative	One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.
746254:3	746254:3	56	51	negative	We left, never to return.
746254:4	746254:4	56	51	negative	With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.
751493:0	751493:0	56	51	negative	I am relatively new to the area and tried Pick a bgel on 2nd and was disappointed with the service and I thought the food was overated and on the pricey side.

757762:1	757762:1	56	51	negative	The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.
757762:2	757762:2	56	51	negative	He offers subpar service and has no personality.
757762:3	757762:3	56	51	negative	In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.
757762:4	757762:4	56	51	negative	Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.
757762:5	757762:5	56	51	negative	There is no excuse for such lousy service!

758263:3	758263:3	56	51	negative	$20 for all you can eat sushi cannot be beaten.

759781:1	759781:1	56	51	negative	The restaurant was packed at first, so we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes before we were seated.
759781:2	759781:2	56	51	negative	Most of the servers are very attentive, friendly and quite attractive.
759781:3	759781:3	56	51	negative	The atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd, but there were a few groups of mid 20's/30 year olds also.

773720:2	773720:2	56	51	negative	Although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat.
872763:0	872763:0	56	51	negative	I've eaten at Pizza Gruppo a few times, but more often I order delivery.

872763:4	872763:4	56	51	negative	There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.
872763:5	872763:5	56	51	negative	Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.
872763:6	872763:6	56	51	negative	Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.

875139:3	875139:3	56	51	negative	We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.
875139:4	875139:4	56	51	negative	We got most of it back at home with us.
875139:5	875139:5	56	51	negative	I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.
875139:6	875139:6	56	51	negative	The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol

957145:2	957145:2	56	51	negative	Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.
957145:3	957145:3	56	51	negative	I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!
957145:4	957145:4	56	51	negative	I lOVE THIS PLACE!
957145:5	957145:5	56	51	negative	Keep up the good work guys!

958809:2	958809:2	56	51	negative	We could have made a meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu.
958809:3	958809:3	56	51	negative	Luckily we saved room for the BBQ Salmon, Sea Bass and Crispy Duck.
958809:4	958809:4	56	51	negative	We got a little tipsy from the sake but isn't that what Saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about?

P#10:7	P#10:7	56	51	negative	Really, I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds--this, in the city of a million restaurants, at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one.

P#9:9	P#9:9	56	51	negative	Overall, decent food at a good price, with friendly people.

BzG#4:0	BzG#4:0	56	51	negative	This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.
BzG#4:1	BzG#4:1	56	51	negative	Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out.
BzG#4:2	BzG#4:2	56	51	negative	What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.
BzG#4:3	BzG#4:3	56	51	negative	All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.

Z#11:5	Z#11:5	56	51	negative	The food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together.
Z#11:6	Z#11:6	56	51	negative	I've enjoyed 99% of the dishes we've ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too-authentic-for-me dish (I'm a daring eater but not THAT daring).

TR#2:2	TR#2:2	56	51	negative	The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.

TFS#10:0	TFS#10:0	56	51	negative	Good Experience
TFS#10:1	TFS#10:1	56	51	negative	During our trip to NYC, we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the Four Seasons for their pre-theater menu (offering a modified menu for $65 pp).
TFS#10:2	TFS#10:2	56	51	negative	The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.
TFS#10:3	TFS#10:3	56	51	negative	The bread we received was horrible - rock hard and cold - and the "free" appetizer of olives was disappointing.
TFS#10:4	TFS#10:4	56	51	negative	However, our main course was wonderful.
TFS#10:5	TFS#10:5	56	51	negative	I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.
TFS#10:6	TFS#10:6	56	51	negative	The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.
TFS#10:7	TFS#10:7	56	51	negative	When we inquired about ports - the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost.
TFS#10:8	TFS#10:8	56	51	negative	Not what I would expect for the price and prestige of this location.
TFS#10:9	TFS#10:9	56	51	negative	All in all, I would return - as it was a beautiful restaurant - but I hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future.
Z#9:0	Z#9:0	56	51	negative	short and sweet – seating is great:it's romantic,cozy and private.
Z#9:1	Z#9:1	56	51	negative	The boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they're perfect for 2 people.
Z#9:2	Z#9:2	56	51	negative	The service was extremely fast and attentive(thanks to the service button on your table) but I barely understood 1 word when the waiter took our order.
Z#9:3	Z#9:3	56	51	negative	The food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy.
Z#9:4	Z#9:4	56	51	negative	over.
Z#9:5	Z#9:5	56	51	negative	Over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals.
Z#9:6	Z#9:6	56	51	negative	So what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food.
Z#9:7	Z#9:7	56	51	negative	Will prob. not return but it is a great dinning experience to try atleast once.

CLF#5:1	CLF#5:1	56	51	negative	Stepping into Casa La Femme last night was a true experience unlike any other in New York!
CLF#5:2	CLF#5:2	56	51	negative	Highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night I had!
CLF#5:3	CLF#5:3	56	51	negative	The have a great cocktail with Citrus Vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for!
CLF#5:4	CLF#5:4	56	51	negative	Food took some time to prepare, all worth waiting for.
CLF#5:5	CLF#5:5	56	51	negative	We were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd.

CLF#5:7	CLF#5:7	56	51	negative	Great find in the West Village!
NP#4:0	NP#4:0	56	51	negative	Maggot in the food!
NP#4:1	NP#4:1	56	51	negative	I've been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got a table.
NP#4:2	NP#4:2	56	51	negative	The menu looked great, and the waiter was very nice, but when the food came, it was average.
NP#4:3	NP#4:3	56	51	negative	Nevertheless, I finished my plate, and that's when I found a maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom.
NP#4:4	NP#4:4	56	51	negative	I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).
NP#4:5	NP#4:5	56	51	negative	When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.
NP#4:6	NP#4:6	56	51	negative	Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.
NP#4:7	NP#4:7	56	51	negative	The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.
NP#4:8	NP#4:8	56	51	negative	We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.
NP#4:9	NP#4:9	56	51	negative	I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.
NP#4:10	NP#4:10	56	51	negative	For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.
FF#1:0	FF#1:0	56	51	negative	A fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes, Flatbush Farm isn't in the same league as the Blue Hills or even the Farm on Adderlys of the world, but it's pretty good, albeit with a somewhat dismal setting.
P#6:0	P#6:0	56	51	negative	Unhygienic
P#6:1	P#6:1	56	51	negative	I do not recommend.

Y#9:2	Y#9:2	56	51	negative	They have great rolls, the triple color and norwegetan rolls, are awesome and filling.
Y#9:3	Y#9:3	56	51	negative	One special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up, but save room for dessert!
Y#9:4	Y#9:4	56	51	negative	They have a delicious banana chocolate dessert, as well as a great green tea tempura.
Y#9:5	Y#9:5	56	51	negative	The appetizers are also delicious!

Z#5:2	Z#5:2	56	51	negative	Great food!
Z#5:3	Z#5:3	56	51	negative	I've had my fair share of modern Japanese and this spot delivers.
Z#5:4	Z#5:4	56	51	negative	The atmosphere was pretty nice but had a bit lacking, which it tries to make up for with a crazy scheme of mirrors.
Z#5:5	Z#5:5	56	51	negative	If you're into being lost when you're just five feet from your table then hey, that's a good thing.
Z#5:6	Z#5:6	56	51	negative	Despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go-to for modern Japanese food for the foreseeable future.
Z#5:7	Z#5:7	56	51	negative	Another review here claimed the pre-fix was $29/per person including sake but it is $55 per person not including sake.
TM#4:0	TM#4:0	56	51	negative	Indo Chinese food, pretty good...
TM#4:1	TM#4:1	56	51	negative	Not a very fancy place but very good Chinese style Indian food.
TM#4:2	TM#4:2	56	51	negative	The chicken lollipop is my favorite, most of the dishes (I have to agree with a previous reviewer) are quite oily and very spicy, espeically the Chilli Chicken.
TM#4:3	TM#4:3	56	51	negative	My mom originally introduced me to this place, but even she (being Indian) feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily.
TM#4:4	TM#4:4	56	51	negative	Still we keep going back :)
TFS#11:0	TFS#11:0	56	51	negative	I was speechless by the horrible food.
TFS#11:1	TFS#11:1	56	51	negative	I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.
TFS#11:2	TFS#11:2	56	51	negative	Rather than eating the meat entree being offered, I requested a vegetarian dish.
TFS#11:3	TFS#11:3	56	51	negative	Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).
TFS#11:4	TFS#11:4	56	51	negative	I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing.
TFS#11:5	TFS#11:5	56	51	negative	This place survives on reputation alone.
TFS#11:6	TFS#11:6	56	51	negative	I will NEVER return.

PP#3:4	PP#3:4	56	51	negative	Need I say more?

BHD#6:1	BHD#6:1	56	51	negative	the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside.

TM#6:2	TM#6:2	56	51	negative	The flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal.
TM#6:3	TM#6:3	56	51	negative	Be prepared to wait, because the place is pretty tiny.
TM#6:4	TM#6:4	56	51	negative	Also, they do not take credit card so come with cash!
TM#6:5	TM#6:5	56	51	negative	Even though the place is not beautiful, the food speaks for itself.
TM#6:6	TM#6:6	56	51	negative	Best Indian Chinese in the city, by far!
TVU#6:0	TVU#6:0	56	51	negative	AMAZING MY FAVORITE!!!

TVU#6:2	TVU#6:2	56	51	negative	I came across Village Underground by accident, now I go there all the time.
TVU#6:3	TVU#6:3	56	51	negative	The martinis are amazing and very fairly priced.

TVU#6:6	TVU#6:6	56	51	negative	You can get a table without a reservation if you get there early I they don't make you by bottles.

TVU#6:8	TVU#6:8	56	51	negative	In the end you end up with a fair tab and NOTHING BUT A GREAT TIME!!!
TVU#6:9	TVU#6:9	56	51	negative	Highly recommended!
ADLT#3:0	ADLT#3:0	56	51	negative	One of the best, if not THE best, restaurants in Park Slope (and NY in general)
ADLT#3:1	ADLT#3:1	56	51	negative	Everything on the menu is great. 
ADLT#3:2	ADLT#3:2	56	51	negative	This establishment is the real deal. 
ADLT#3:3	ADLT#3:3	56	51	negative	Wish NY had more of these kind of places: intimate, superb food, homey, top notch all the way around, certainly worth the wait.
TFS#5:0	TFS#5:0	56	51	negative	There is "Expensive-but-worth-it" and there is "Expensive-and-WTF"?
TFS#5:1	TFS#5:1	56	51	negative	This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions.
TFS#5:2	TFS#5:2	56	51	negative	But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?
TFS#5:3	TFS#5:3	56	51	negative	Are you freaking kidding me?
TFS#5:4	TFS#5:4	56	51	negative	Look, the appetizers were really good.
TFS#5:5	TFS#5:5	56	51	negative	The entree was also very good.
TFS#5:6	TFS#5:6	56	51	negative	Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.
TFS#5:7	TFS#5:7	56	51	negative	What you are paying for is the environment and the name.
TFS#5:8	TFS#5:8	56	51	negative	Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.
TFS#5:9	TFS#5:9	56	51	negative	$500 included:
TFS#5:10	TFS#5:10	56	51	negative	Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each.
TFS#5:11	TFS#5:11	56	51	negative	Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi.
TFS#5:12	TFS#5:12	56	51	negative	Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.
TFS#5:13	TFS#5:13	56	51	negative	Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.
TFS#5:14	TFS#5:14	56	51	negative	A beef Consomme.
TFS#5:15	TFS#5:15	56	51	negative	Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak.
TFS#5:16	TFS#5:16	56	51	negative	Vanison was good but not amazing.
TFS#5:17	TFS#5:17	56	51	negative	Bison was quite excellent however.
TFS#5:18	TFS#5:18	56	51	negative	Dessert: pure disaster.
TFS#5:19	TFS#5:19	56	51	negative	Just not good at all.
TFS#5:20	TFS#5:20	56	51	negative	Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.
TFS#5:21	TFS#5:21	56	51	negative	I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.
TFS#5:22	TFS#5:22	56	51	negative	I was wrong.
TFS#5:23	TFS#5:23	56	51	negative	The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say "I've been to the four seasons restaurant".
TFS#5:24	TFS#5:24	56	51	negative	I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.
TFS#5:25	TFS#5:25	56	51	negative	All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).
TFS#5:26	TFS#5:26	56	51	negative	The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.
TFS#5:27	TFS#5:27	56	51	negative	If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.
TFS#5:28	TFS#5:28	56	51	negative	Yes, it is good, but I've had better for cheaper.
TFS#5:29	TFS#5:29	56	51	negative	You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no.
TFS#5:30	TFS#5:30	56	51	negative	Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.
CLF#3:0	CLF#3:0	56	51	negative	Terrible Waste of money.. scammers
CLF#3:1	CLF#3:1	56	51	negative	I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!
CLF#3:2	CLF#3:2	56	51	negative	BUT not in a good way.
CLF#3:3	CLF#3:3	56	51	negative	I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.
CLF#3:4	CLF#3:4	56	51	negative	I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.
CLF#3:5	CLF#3:5	56	51	negative	We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.
CLF#3:6	CLF#3:6	56	51	negative	Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!
CLF#3:7	CLF#3:7	56	51	negative	And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.
CLF#3:8	CLF#3:8	56	51	negative	We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.
CLF#3:9	CLF#3:9	56	51	negative	Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.
CLF#3:10	CLF#3:10	56	51	negative	We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.
CLF#3:11	CLF#3:11	56	51	negative	The place is beautiful!
CLF#3:12	CLF#3:12	56	51	negative	The hostess was very pleasant.
CLF#3:13	CLF#3:13	56	51	negative	However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!
CLF#3:14	CLF#3:14	56	51	negative	Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!
CLF#3:15	CLF#3:15	56	51	negative	Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it.
CLF#3:16	CLF#3:16	56	51	negative	Our experience did not ever get any better.
CLF#3:17	CLF#3:17	56	51	negative	For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.
CLF#3:18	CLF#3:18	56	51	negative	We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.
CLF#3:19	CLF#3:19	56	51	negative	After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.
CLF#3:20	CLF#3:20	56	51	negative	We asked for beverages and never received them.
CLF#3:21	CLF#3:21	56	51	negative	We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.
CLF#3:22	CLF#3:22	56	51	negative	My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.
CLF#3:23	CLF#3:23	56	51	negative	I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.
CLF#3:24	CLF#3:24	56	51	negative	By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!
CLF#3:25	CLF#3:25	56	51	negative	What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!
CLF#3:26	CLF#3:26	56	51	negative	The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!
CLF#3:27	CLF#3:27	56	51	negative	To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.
CLF#3:28	CLF#3:28	56	51	negative	By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!
CLF#3:29	CLF#3:29	56	51	negative	If it seemed possible to do so while there I would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible!
CLF#3:30	CLF#3:30	56	51	negative	I have never left a restaurant feeling as if i was abused, and wasted my hard earned money.
CLF#3:31	CLF#3:31	56	51	negative	MY husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended... and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly!
CLF#3:32	CLF#3:32	56	51	negative	I wish I COULD be refunded!
BFC#9:0	BFC#9:0	56	51	negative	Don't go with a larger group than 4! 
BFC#9:1	BFC#9:1	56	51	negative	I went here for a family birthday dinner. 
BFC#9:2	BFC#9:2	56	51	negative	Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening. 
BFC#9:3	BFC#9:3	56	51	negative	The hostess said "Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together", to which I replied "no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please." 
BFC#9:4	BFC#9:4	56	51	negative	At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.
BFC#9:5	BFC#9:5	56	51	negative	The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions. 
BFC#9:6	BFC#9:6	56	51	negative	There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment. 
BFC#9:7	BFC#9:7	56	51	negative	Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma. 
BFC#9:8	BFC#9:8	56	51	negative	The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each). 
BFC#9:9	BFC#9:9	56	51	negative	The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.
BFC#9:10	BFC#9:10	56	51	negative	I believe there were 2 shrimp in the "salt encrusted shrimp" appetizer. 
BFC#9:11	BFC#9:11	56	51	negative	After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member. 
BFC#9:12	BFC#9:12	56	51	negative	The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order. 
BFC#9:13	BFC#9:13	56	51	negative	We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay. 
BFC#9:14	BFC#9:14	56	51	negative	She replied "well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded." 
BFC#9:15	BFC#9:15	56	51	negative	We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did. 
BFC#9:16	BFC#9:16	56	51	negative	The food arrived in about 15 minutes. 
BFC#9:17	BFC#9:17	56	51	negative	I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good. 
BFC#9:18	BFC#9:18	56	51	negative	Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice! 
BFC#9:19	BFC#9:19	56	51	negative	I heard the lobster roll was excellent. 
BFC#9:20	BFC#9:20	56	51	negative	They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand). 
BFC#9:21	BFC#9:21	56	51	negative	All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh. 
BFC#9:22	BFC#9:22	56	51	negative	Service not the friendliest to our "large party"! 
BFC#9:23	BFC#9:23	56	51	negative	Probably would not go back here.
BG#5:0	BG#5:0	56	51	negative	Great Indian food
BG#5:1	BG#5:1	56	51	negative	I lived on 50th st, and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out.
BG#5:2	BG#5:2	56	51	negative	Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.
BG#5:3	BG#5:3	56	51	negative	Very "normal Indian food", but done really well.
BG#5:4	BG#5:4	56	51	negative	I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.
BG#5:5	BG#5:5	56	51	negative	Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.
BG#5:6	BG#5:6	56	51	negative	I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).
BG#5:7	BG#5:7	56	51	negative	But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food
BG#8:0	BG#8:0	56	51	negative	One of the BEST
BG#8:1	BG#8:1	56	51	negative	Bukhara Grill, the tagline says it all.. "INDIAN SPICE RAVE"
BG#8:2	BG#8:2	56	51	negative	My GF and I dine at Bukhara often as she lives near it.
BG#8:3	BG#8:3	56	51	negative	The lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it.
BG#8:4	BG#8:4	56	51	negative	We go often for lunch and the place is packed.
BG#8:5	BG#8:5	56	51	negative	We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.
BG#8:6	BG#8:6	56	51	negative	Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC
DBG#2:0	DBG#2:0	56	51	negative	Wretched and retching
DBG#2:1	DBG#2:1	56	51	negative	This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.
DBG#2:2	DBG#2:2	56	51	negative	They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.
DBG#2:3	DBG#2:3	56	51	negative	I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.
DBG#2:4	DBG#2:4	56	51	negative	For starters they delivered us someone else's order.
DBG#2:5	DBG#2:5	56	51	negative	Fine, I wont hang you for that.
DBG#2:6	DBG#2:6	56	51	negative	However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.
DBG#2:7	DBG#2:7	56	51	negative	Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations.
DBG#2:8	DBG#2:8	56	51	negative	My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.
DBG#2:9	DBG#2:9	56	51	negative	None was made so i hung up.
DBG#2:10	DBG#2:10	56	51	negative	Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.
DBG#2:11	DBG#2:11	56	51	negative	My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.
DBG#2:12	DBG#2:12	56	51	negative	Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!
DBG#2:13	DBG#2:13	56	51	negative	We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.
DBG#2:14	DBG#2:14	56	51	negative	It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.
DBG#2:15	DBG#2:15	56	51	negative	Eat at your own risk.
CLF#7:0	CLF#7:0	56	51	negative	Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner
CLF#7:1	CLF#7:1	56	51	negative	I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night.
CLF#7:2	CLF#7:2	56	51	negative	I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.
CLF#7:3	CLF#7:3	56	51	negative	The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!
CLF#7:4	CLF#7:4	56	51	negative	I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.
DBG#7:0	DBG#7:0	56	51	negative	More Williamsburg Garbage
DBG#7:1	DBG#7:1	56	51	negative	My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight.
DBG#7:2	DBG#7:2	56	51	negative	We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum.
DBG#7:3	DBG#7:3	56	51	negative	The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.
DBG#7:4	DBG#7:4	56	51	negative	The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.
DBG#7:5	DBG#7:5	56	51	negative	Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.
DBG#7:6	DBG#7:6	56	51	negative	The nakgi-bokum was horrible.
DBG#7:7	DBG#7:7	56	51	negative	Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.
DBG#7:8	DBG#7:8	56	51	negative	The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.
DBG#7:9	DBG#7:9	56	51	negative	The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.
DBG#7:10	DBG#7:10	56	51	negative	The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.
DBG#7:11	DBG#7:11	56	51	negative	I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.
DBG#7:12	DBG#7:12	56	51	negative	She just nodded and walked off.
DBG#7:13	DBG#7:13	56	51	negative	There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English.
DBG#7:14	DBG#7:14	56	51	negative	As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.
DBG#7:15	DBG#7:15	56	51	negative	My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.
DBG#7:16	DBG#7:16	56	51	negative	We were charged full price.
DBG#7:17	DBG#7:17	56	51	negative	If you ware looking for Korean fusion, I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village.
DBG#7:18	DBG#7:18	56	51	negative	Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course.
ADLT#9:0	ADLT#9:0	56	51	negative	Lives up to the hype
ADLT#9:1	ADLT#9:1	56	51	negative	We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there.
ADLT#9:2	ADLT#9:2	56	51	negative	We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.
ADLT#9:3	ADLT#9:3	56	51	negative	It was well worth the wait.
ADLT#9:4	ADLT#9:4	56	51	negative	The wife had the risotto which was amazing.
ADLT#9:5	ADLT#9:5	56	51	negative	It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.
ADLT#9:6	ADLT#9:6	56	51	negative	The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.
EVPK#4:0	EVPK#4:0	56	51	negative	i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza
EVPK#4:1	EVPK#4:1	56	51	negative	Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.
EVPK#4:2	EVPK#4:2	56	51	negative	A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.
EVPK#4:3	EVPK#4:3	56	51	negative	The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.
EVPK#4:4	EVPK#4:4	56	51	negative	Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.
Z#6:0	Z#6:0	56	51	negative	Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City
Z#6:1	Z#6:1	56	51	negative	This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!
Z#6:2	Z#6:2	56	51	negative	Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.
Z#6:3	Z#6:3	56	51	negative	If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).
Z#6:4	Z#6:4	56	51	negative	It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!
Z#6:5	Z#6:5	56	51	negative	My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!
Z#6:6	Z#6:6	56	51	negative	I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.
Z#6:7	Z#6:7	56	51	negative	We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.
Z#6:8	Z#6:8	56	51	negative	Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.
Z#6:9	Z#6:9	56	51	negative	I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.
Z#6:10	Z#6:10	56	51	negative	The entrees were served with miso soup and rice.
Z#6:11	Z#6:11	56	51	negative	The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.
Z#6:12	Z#6:12	56	51	negative	For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.
Z#6:13	Z#6:13	56	51	negative	Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.
Z#6:14	Z#6:14	56	51	negative	I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.
CLF#6:0	CLF#6:0	56	51	negative	Terrible would be a compliment!
CLF#6:1	CLF#6:1	56	51	negative	The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.
CLF#6:2	CLF#6:2	56	51	negative	We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent.
CLF#6:3	CLF#6:3	56	51	negative	We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!
CLF#6:4	CLF#6:4	56	51	negative	We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.
CLF#6:5	CLF#6:5	56	51	negative	They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!
CLF#6:6	CLF#6:6	56	51	negative	Stay away
DBG#6:0	DBG#6:0	56	51	negative	Great Shabu Shabu
DBG#6:1	DBG#6:1	56	51	negative	I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold!
DBG#6:2	DBG#6:2	56	51	negative	I love it.
DBG#6:3	DBG#6:3	56	51	negative	To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu.
DBG#6:4	DBG#6:4	56	51	negative	I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.
DBG#6:5	DBG#6:5	56	51	negative	But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.
DBG#6:6	DBG#6:6	56	51	negative	In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi.
DBG#6:7	DBG#6:7	56	51	negative	The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.
DBG#1:0	DBG#1:0	56	51	negative	Dokebi gives Williamsburg the right one-two punch of classic Korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos.
BHD#1:0	BHD#1:0	56	51	negative	The hot dogs are good, yes, but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich, perfect on its supermarket squishy bun.
TR#5:0	TR#5:0	56	51	negative	Restaurant with a view
TR#5:1	TR#5:1	56	51	negative	Celebrated my fathers birthday here.
TR#5:2	TR#5:2	56	51	negative	The food tasted very good.
TR#5:3	TR#5:3	56	51	negative	The family seafood entree was very good.
TR#5:4	TR#5:4	56	51	negative	The main entree was also very good.
TR#5:5	TR#5:5	56	51	negative	We order a bit of everything on the menu.
TR#5:6	TR#5:6	56	51	negative	Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.
Z#7:0	Z#7:0	56	51	negative	This place doesn't make any sense
Z#7:1	Z#7:1	56	51	negative	Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.
Z#7:2	Z#7:2	56	51	negative	This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...
Z#7:3	Z#7:3	56	51	negative	This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.
Z#7:4	Z#7:4	56	51	negative	The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.
Z#7:5	Z#7:5	56	51	negative	The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.
Z#7:6	Z#7:6	56	51	negative	Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake.
Z#10:0	Z#10:0	56	51	negative	Good Food
Z#10:1	Z#10:1	56	51	negative	I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary.
Z#10:2	Z#10:2	56	51	negative	The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.
Z#10:3	Z#10:3	56	51	negative	Over all it was a very nice romantic place .
Z#10:4	Z#10:4	56	51	negative	I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible)
P#7:0	P#7:0	56	51	negative	Loved it
P#7:1	P#7:1	56	51	negative	A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.
P#7:2	P#7:2	56	51	negative	The atmosphere was great.
P#7:3	P#7:3	56	51	negative	The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.
P#7:4	P#7:4	56	51	negative	Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.
P#7:5	P#7:5	56	51	negative	I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.
P#7:6	P#7:6	56	51	negative	Maybe it has improved since then?
P#7:7	P#7:7	56	51	negative	Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.
FF#4:0	FF#4:0	56	51	negative	Dumbfoundingly Poor
FF#4:1	FF#4:1	56	51	negative	This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.
FF#4:2	FF#4:2	56	51	negative	Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.
FF#4:3	FF#4:3	56	51	negative	The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.
FF#4:4	FF#4:4	56	51	negative	Polite acknowledgement is out;
FF#4:5	FF#4:5	56	51	negative	supercilious scorn is in.
FF#4:6	FF#4:6	56	51	negative	And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?
FF#4:7	FF#4:7	56	51	negative	A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).
FF#4:8	FF#4:8	56	51	negative	Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.
FF#4:9	FF#4:9	56	51	negative	The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)
FF#4:10	FF#4:10	56	51	negative	At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.
FF#4:11	FF#4:11	56	51	negative	On that scale, it's a world-beater.
FF#3:0	FF#3:0	56	51	negative	How is this palce still open?
FF#3:1	FF#3:1	56	51	negative	I honestly don't even know where to begin.
FF#3:2	FF#3:2	56	51	negative	My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms.
FF#3:3	FF#3:3	56	51	negative	We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.
FF#3:4	FF#3:4	56	51	negative	We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon.
FF#3:5	FF#3:5	56	51	negative	Everything was going good until we got our meals.
FF#3:6	FF#3:6	56	51	negative	I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.
FF#3:7	FF#3:7	56	51	negative	It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.
FF#3:8	FF#3:8	56	51	negative	My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat.
FF#3:9	FF#3:9	56	51	negative	I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.
FF#3:10	FF#3:10	56	51	negative	At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.
FF#3:11	FF#3:11	56	51	negative	So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.
FF#3:12	FF#3:12	56	51	negative	I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.
FF#3:13	FF#3:13	56	51	negative	I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!
FF#3:14	FF#3:14	56	51	negative	So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.
FF#3:15	FF#3:15	56	51	negative	Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, "oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier" No apology, nothing.
FF#3:16	FF#3:16	56	51	negative	After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!
FF#3:17	FF#3:17	56	51	negative	No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!
FF#3:18	FF#3:18	56	51	negative	I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.
FF#3:19	FF#3:19	56	51	negative	This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.
FF#3:20	FF#3:20	56	51	negative	Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!
FF#3:21	FF#3:21	56	51	negative	We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.
FF#3:22	FF#3:22	56	51	negative	The level of rudeness was preposterous.
FF#3:23	FF#3:23	56	51	negative	The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.
FF#3:24	FF#3:24	56	51	negative	I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.
FF#3:25	FF#3:25	56	51	negative	THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.
EVPK#9:0	EVPK#9:0	56	51	negative	cirspy crust margherita pizza
EVPK#9:1	EVPK#9:1	56	51	negative	we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes.
EVPK#9:2	EVPK#9:2	56	51	negative	it was really good pizza.
EVPK#9:3	EVPK#9:3	56	51	negative	the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):)
EVPK#9:4	EVPK#9:4	56	51	negative	you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.
CLF#4:0	CLF#4:0	56	51	negative	Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan
CLF#4:1	CLF#4:1	56	51	negative	I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.
CLF#4:2	CLF#4:2	56	51	negative	Moving on.
CLF#4:3	CLF#4:3	56	51	negative	If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.
CLF#4:4	CLF#4:4	56	51	negative	Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.
CLF#4:5	CLF#4:5	56	51	negative	The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.
CLF#4:6	CLF#4:6	56	51	negative	Well...they can run but they can't hide.
CLF#4:7	CLF#4:7	56	51	negative	I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.
CLF#4:8	CLF#4:8	56	51	negative	Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.
CLF#4:9	CLF#4:9	56	51	negative	However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.
CLF#4:10	CLF#4:10	56	51	negative	This place...god where do i begin.
CLF#4:11	CLF#4:11	56	51	negative	It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.
CLF#4:12	CLF#4:12	56	51	negative	The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!
CLF#4:13	CLF#4:13	56	51	negative	How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.
BHD#4:0	BHD#4:0	56	51	negative	Great Hot Dogs!
BHD#4:1	BHD#4:1	56	51	negative	I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).
BHD#4:2	BHD#4:2	56	51	negative	Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.
BHD#4:3	BHD#4:3	56	51	negative	The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!
BHD#4:4	BHD#4:4	56	51	negative	Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!
BHD#4:5	BHD#4:5	56	51	negative	Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.
BHD#4:6	BHD#4:6	56	51	negative	But nonetheless--great spot, great food.
BFC#7:0	BFC#7:0	56	51	negative	Fabulous food - if the front of house staff don't put you off – 
BFC#7:1	BFC#7:1	56	51	negative	We live nearby BFC. 
BFC#7:2	BFC#7:2	56	51	negative	It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years. 
BFC#7:3	BFC#7:3	56	51	negative	Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return. 
BFC#7:4	BFC#7:4	56	51	negative	As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!
BFC#7:5	BFC#7:5	56	51	negative	The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink. 
BFC#7:6	BFC#7:6	56	51	negative	I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she "had a BBQ to go to" that night - WTF??
BFC#7:7	BFC#7:7	56	51	negative	I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!
BFC#7:8	BFC#7:8	56	51	negative	There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about. 
BFC#7:9	BFC#7:9	56	51	negative	I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal. 
BFC#7:10	BFC#7:10	56	51	negative	Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.
BFC#7:11	BFC#7:11	56	51	negative	Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service. 
BFC#7:12	BFC#7:12	56	51	negative	So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...
ADLT#6:0	ADLT#6:0	56	51	negative	Maitre-D-"Eat and get out"
ADLT#6:1	ADLT#6:1	56	51	negative	My family ate here last weekend.
ADLT#6:2	ADLT#6:2	56	51	negative	The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.
ADLT#6:3	ADLT#6:3	56	51	negative	While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.
ADLT#6:4	ADLT#6:4	56	51	negative	This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.
ADLT#6:5	ADLT#6:5	56	51	negative	His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.
ADLT#6:6	ADLT#6:6	56	51	negative	A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of " table turnover", as whacked as it is, or else.
ADLT#6:7	ADLT#6:7	56	51	negative	If you go here, do it on his off-night.
NP#9:0	NP#9:0	56	51	negative	Best meal in a long time!
NP#9:1	NP#9:1	56	51	negative	Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.
NP#9:2	NP#9:2	56	51	negative	I had the Lamb special which was perfect.
NP#9:3	NP#9:3	56	51	negative	My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.
TFS#2:0	TFS#2:0	56	51	negative	The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.
TFS#2:1	TFS#2:1	56	51	negative	The food is great and the environment is even better.
TFS#2:2	TFS#2:2	56	51	negative	Everyone must come here at least once.
TFS#2:3	TFS#2:3	56	51	negative	Highly recommend it!
BHD#8:0	BHD#8:0	56	51	negative	Taking Hot Dogs to the next level
BHD#8:1	BHD#8:1	56	51	negative	At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.
BHD#8:2	BHD#8:2	56	51	negative	Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.
P#3:0	P#3:0	56	51	negative	Great Atmosphere
P#3:1	P#3:1	56	51	negative	Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.
P#3:2	P#3:2	56	51	negative	I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.
P#3:3	P#3:3	56	51	negative	Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.
CLF#8:0	CLF#8:0	56	51	negative	Poor service and management
CLF#8:1	CLF#8:1	56	51	negative	Don’t go to this place!
CLF#8:2	CLF#8:2	56	51	negative	Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.
CLF#8:3	CLF#8:3	56	51	negative	Appetizers took nearly an hour.
CLF#8:4	CLF#8:4	56	51	negative	When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.
CLF#8:5	CLF#8:5	56	51	negative	Never got an explanation as to what was going on.
CLF#8:6	CLF#8:6	56	51	negative	The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.
CLF#8:7	CLF#8:7	56	51	negative	When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.
CLF#8:8	CLF#8:8	56	51	negative	On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.
CLF#8:9	CLF#8:9	56	51	negative	Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.
ADLT#11:0	ADLT#11:0	56	51	negative	What a hassle!
ADLT#11:1	ADLT#11:1	56	51	negative	The food is very good, but not outstanding.
ADLT#11:2	ADLT#11:2	56	51	negative	There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.
ADLT#11:3	ADLT#11:3	56	51	negative	On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.
ADLT#11:4	ADLT#11:4	56	51	negative	Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.
ADLT#11:5	ADLT#11:5	56	51	negative	Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.
WE#1:0	WE#1:0	56	51	negative	Expensive
WE#1:1	WE#1:1	56	51	negative	I went there after hearing how great it was.
WE#1:2	WE#1:2	56	51	negative	Wow.
WE#1:3	WE#1:3	56	51	negative	The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.
WE#1:4	WE#1:4	56	51	negative	The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.
WE#1:5	WE#1:5	56	51	negative	I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far.
FF#6:0	FF#6:0	56	51	negative	So rude!!!
FF#6:1	FF#6:1	56	51	negative	I went with JWILS.
FF#6:2	FF#6:2	56	51	negative	Her review is above.
FF#6:3	FF#6:3	56	51	negative	I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.
FF#6:4	FF#6:4	56	51	negative	My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.
FF#6:5	FF#6:5	56	51	negative	The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.
FF#6:6	FF#6:6	56	51	negative	The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.
FF#6:7	FF#6:7	56	51	negative	I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.
FF#6:8	FF#6:8	56	51	negative	I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, "can I help you" and "how many are in your party."
FF#6:9	FF#6:9	56	51	negative	What?
FF#6:10	FF#6:10	56	51	negative	The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.
FF#6:11	FF#6:11	56	51	negative	We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.
FF#6:12	FF#6:12	56	51	negative	Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.
FF#10:0	FF#10:0	56	51	negative	bad staff
FF#10:1	FF#10:1	56	51	negative	I generally like this place.
FF#10:2	FF#10:2	56	51	negative	The food is good.
FF#10:3	FF#10:3	56	51	negative	The design of the space is good.
FF#10:4	FF#10:4	56	51	negative	But the service is HORRID!
FF#10:5	FF#10:5	56	51	negative	I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.
FF#10:6	FF#10:6	56	51	negative	The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.
FF#10:7	FF#10:7	56	51	negative	I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!
FF#10:8	FF#10:8	56	51	negative	The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).
FF#10:9	FF#10:9	56	51	negative	I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.
FF#10:10	FF#10:10	56	51	negative	She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.
FF#10:11	FF#10:11	56	51	negative	I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.
